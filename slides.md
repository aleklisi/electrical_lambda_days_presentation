"Last year, Google used about **12.4 terawatt-hours** of electricity, which means it uses more electric power than entire countries, including ones like Sri Lanka and Zambia." [2] the article is form 2020

Total electricity used by Meta (Facebook) in 2020 was **7,170,000 MWh**. [3]

Total electricity used by Microsoft in 2019 was **8,741,807 MWh**. [4]

"In 2020, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,715 kilowatthours (kWh)[...]" [5]
